        StepModel(stepNumber: 1, title: "One"),
        StepModel(stepNumber: 2, title: "Two"),
        StepModel(stepNumber: 3, title: "Three"),
        StepModel(stepNumber: 4, title: "Four"),
        StepModel(stepNumber: 5, title: "‚ÄçFive")
    ]
    
     StepperView(steps: steps, currentStep: $currentState, direction: .leftToRight)
     .frame(width: metrics.size.width, height: 100)
     .padding(.top, 10)
```
